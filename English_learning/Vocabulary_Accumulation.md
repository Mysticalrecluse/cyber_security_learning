第一部分（由“while”引导）: "While highlighting evolving trends in family dynamics and parental involvement across the country," - 这部分描述了研究的一个方面，即强调或突出全国范围内家庭动态和父母参与度的变化趋势。

第二部分: "the study also underscores the need to implement and extend paternity leave policies to address the issue of 'widowed parenting.'" - 这部分则强调了研究的另一个重点，即实施和扩大产假政策的必要性，以解决“单亲养育”问题。

在这里，“while”用来指出，虽然研究强调了家庭动态和父母参与的变化，但它也强调了处理“单亲养育”问题的不同方面（即通过产假政策）。这样的用法是为了同时提出两个相关但是不同的观点或发现。
